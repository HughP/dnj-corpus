# Eastern Dan [dnj] corpus and text input analysis

## Sections

### Corpora in Languages
 * A medium size corpus in Eastern Dan [dnj]
  * The Eastern Dan corpus consists of issues of a local newspaper (_˗Pamɛbhamɛ_), and medical counsels (chapters) from _While waiting for a medical doctor_ translated into Eastern Dan. A detailed description of the corpus is available [here](/Writing-System-Descriptions/Eastern-Dan/ReadMe.md).
 * A parallel corpus (the New Testament book of James) in following languages: Spanish [spa], French [fra], English [eng], Eastern Dan [dnj], Me'phaa [tcf], Mandarin [cmn], plus two Nigerian languages [bkv], and [eza].

### Writing System Descriptions
 [`/Writing-System-Descriptions`](/Writing-System-Descriptions) The focus here is on the Eastern Dan writing system in general but some description also exists for the other languages in the parallel corpus. In the process of attempting to describe Eastern Dan's text input options, this corpus description also attempts a modest application of the principles set out by Martin Hosken for _Writing System Descriptions_. A specific analysis of the text input options for Eastern Dan also exists under the _Text Input Systems and their Descriptions_ section.
