# dnj-corpus
A small corpus of a local newspaper (_˗Pamɛbhamɛ_), and medical counsels (chapters) from _While waiting for a medical doctor_ translated into Eastern Dan. This corpus description also attempts a modest application of the principles set out by Martin Hosken for _Writing System Descriptions_. And an analysis of the text input options for Eastern Dan.

## Sections

 * A medium size corpus in Eastern Dan [dnj]
