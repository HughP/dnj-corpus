# Corpora

There are two folders in this section. `James` and `Eastern-Dan-Full-Text`.

The James folder contains a parallel corpus in a set of languages [dnj], [cmn], [spa], [eng], [fra], [tcf], [bkv], and [eza], while the Eastern Dan folder contains several iterations of the final output for the Eastern Dan corpus which was amassed as the main purpose of this repo.
