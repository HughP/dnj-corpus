# Explaining the Corpora

`[tcf]Santiago-SFMsRemoved_not_corrupted.txt` this corpora is the James text for Me'phaa [tcf] with out the SFM markers (verses and chapters), but I think the section headdings are still in the text. It is hard to tell without the SFMs, and I wasn't taking notes at the time the SFMs were removed.

`converted-mephaa.txt` This corpora is the james text for Me'phaa [tcf] which has been converted from the Me'phaa orthography to work in the computational units like Typing and KLA. The characters replaced are replaced with the values of the QWERTY characters but it is assumed that the Me'phaa keyboard was used.
